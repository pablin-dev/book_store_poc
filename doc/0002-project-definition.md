## Why this project

### Necessity

We need to increase company showing capabilities to future clients. We decided to increase our portfolio showcase that represent an online shopping that allow clients to search, select and purchase books.

### Problematic

As a new company we want to attract future clients. We think that increasing our portfolio showcases to show how we work may lead us to increase our customer clients. We decided to create a Book Store showcase with the latest technology using different programming languages and taking into consideration the software development phases.

### How we are going to proceed

We are going to separate in the design stage what the executable specifications from "What" the system is intended to do by the user perspective from "how" the system do from his owns perspective. We are going to use BDD approach to achieve this.
Furthermore, we are going to write acceptance test on the design part that can run on different architectures and language implementations to assert that the system is what the user expects.

## Decision

## Consequences

What becomes easier or more difficult to do, and any risks introduced by the change that will need to be mitigated.
